# Portfolio

Hey Jon, hope you are able to run this alright. You should just need to open the PortfolioServer folder, and open the Package.swift file. Then just simply run it like you would an XCode project. Only the Informed app actually has features for you to see. I need to build an interface for adding stuff on the Mac, maybe a command line app. I would incorperate the conversion of markdown for the code snippets into html into the server as well.
